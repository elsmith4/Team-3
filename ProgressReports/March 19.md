### Accomplishments:
* Completed project pitch & decided to use Evernote as our "open-source" software 
* Delegated tasks to each group member last week with the intent to complete most of the assignment before spring break
* Completed the content section of the project outline  including specific sources and demonstration images along with where and how they will be placed within the text. 

### Unfinished Tasks:
Audience profile section of our project outline 

### Revisions:
* We were granted permission to use Evernote even though it is not an open source software program. In our project we've decided to include instructions on finding open-source replacements for Evernote. 

### Group Problems:
* Not all team members completed tasks by the date agreed upon 
* The team leader has done all of the work that has been completed so far - is worried about fair distribution of work 
* Still having trouble contacting one another and collaborating effectively 


### Late status reports:
Team leader has tried contacting other 2 group members about completing tasks on time- has not heard back from either.
