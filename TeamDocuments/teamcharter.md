###Broad Team Goals
* Work together collaboratively
* Learn more about open source platforms
* Provide a successful and useful set of instructions through an open source platform

###Measurable Team Goals
* Communicate with one another effectively and efficiently
* Turn in every assignment on or before its due date 
* Submit work that we are proud of that is representative of our education level

###Individual Goals
* Ariana: My goal for this project is to learn more about coding and writing in markdown. I'm interested in learning more about technical writing so I can develop a new skillset that may benefit me throughout my career.
* Landry: My goal for this project is to broaden my understanding of coding.  I took some computer coding classes in high school but never actively pursued it any further.  I am interested to learn more and possibly pursue a career in it.
* Ross:

###Individual Commitment
* Ariana: As project manager, I will remain organized and on task. I will do the best work that I am capable of and volunteer for completing tasks as long as work is evenly distributed. I will be doing the majority of my work M T and TH afternoons and am available most evenings if a group meeting is necessary. 
* Landry: For this project, I intend to do all the work that is required of me in a timely and professional manner.  I intend to collaborate well with my team and divide work fairly and evenly.  Because the majority of my classes are online this semester, my work schedule is extremely flexible and am able to work most hours of the day.
* Ross: 

###Other Concerns
* Our group got to a slow start contacting each other and completing tasks this week. In the future we hope to communicate in a more timely manner relative to due dates. 
* We want to remain committed to accomplishing tasks on or before due dates so we may have time to revise if necessary. 

###Conflict Resolution
First we will adress any problems as a group. If the conflict cannot be resolved between the three of us, the instructor will be notified so he can mediate and offer a solution.

###Missed Deadlines
* If we forsee missing a deadline for a legitimate reason, we will first ask for a project extension. 
* If granted an extension, we will be determined to submit our work after 24 hours- at the most.
* If a deadline is missed it will be mentioned in the progress report. 

###Unacceptable Work
* Since one of our team goals is to submit work that is in line with our own education level, we hope that this will not be an issue.
* If work is submitted that does not represent what we are truly capable of, the group will adress this issue and work on the revising process together.
