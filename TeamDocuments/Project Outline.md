***Project Outline***

**Overall organization of documentation:** We will use one folder as opposed to multiple. The folder will have each roman numeral topic (Signing up for Evernote, Create a note, Creating Notebooks, Creating and using to-do-lists, Scanning handwritten and typed documents, Keeping relevant web information handy, & Final conclusions) listed in bullet points. Each topic will be an external link that once clicked on will open a separate document with instructions and subtopics for each. The separate document will include all relevant information and images/demonstrations for that main topic.

**Use of multimedia content:** use of the multimedia content we will be using is specified in our content outline. We will mostly be using screenshots. However, we are using the external source Evernote.com for a few images. 

**External links:** use of external links (Evernote.com) are specified in our content outline. The only external links we are using are:

* Evernote.com
* https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/217961187 - for help with the general organization and idea generation of our project.
* https://www.evernote.com/shard/s308/sh/1fb000de-0f8c-42b5-afd6-487841c3c4db/d010fe428334c514  - demonstration image of “For academic use” for using to-do lists.
* https://opensource.com/alternatives/evernote - a screenshot for “Open source replacements to Evernote”.
* The Evernote application on our personal and mobile computers will be used for screenshot images.
